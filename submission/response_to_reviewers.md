**L17-22 The opening paragraph is too abstract. The introduction would read much better, in my opinion, if it starts by the second paragraph.**

As suggested, I have removed the opening paragraph and started with the second.


**L177-193. This part seems to be written mostly to criticize QIME rather than to highlight differences between the two programs. I agree wholeheartedly with every part of it, but still suggest rewriting it with an eye to highlight efforts to simplify things in mothur, rather than to highlight difficulties in using QIME.**

I appreciate this feedback and would rather not come off too strongly against QIIME. I have added a sentence describing the benefits of the approach QIIME has taken (L177-180).
